## Problem Statement: LocaleDate, DateTimeFormatter and Period ##

This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique

  - Write Test classes in TDD approach 
  - Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass 
  - Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below
  
  ```
   In this problem, Given investment date as input then duration and maturity date are manipulated  
        
   - Following functionality needs to be implemented in TDD approach
   
            - Should return the maturity date given the investment date and duration 
            - Should return the duration given investment date and maturity date
   
   - Empty and null inputs should be checked 
   ```
Class BankDeposit  must be implemented using TDD for the following methods 

    + getMaturityDate(String investmentDate, Period duration):String
             return the duration of deposit to the investment date and returns the maturity date                    
   
 **Note**: Use DateTimeFormatter and Period
